            <p1>I've decided to major in computer science with a focus on business. I've always been drawn to computers. They seem to be speaking to me on some level, and I wanted to learn how to respond in their language. I also play a lot of video games, and ever since I was around twelve, I've wanted to learn how to write and design games. The continued rise in the number of gadgets with single-chip computers and Internet connections is another reason I want to major in computer science. These devices have a ton of fascinating applications, and I want to learn how to use them and write software to control and improve them. As a programmer, I'm constantly learning how to advance my knowledge of web development in a variety of ways on my personal journey.</p1>

            <p> Web design refers to the design of websites. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</p>

            <h1 class="headings">UX/UI Design</h1>
            <p> UX design focuses on the interaction that a human user has with everyday products and services. The goal of UX design is to make using these products and services, both digital or physical, easy, logical, and fun.
                <br>UI (User Interface) design is the user-centered approach to designing the aesthetics of a digital product. In essence, they create the look and feel of a website or applicationâ€™s user interface. An interface is the graphical layout of the application. These interfaces should not only be functional, but they should be easy to use and visually appealing.
